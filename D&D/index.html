              ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
              At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases

              <br>
              You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw,
              and does so
              with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is
              charmed by
              you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed
              creature
              regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed
              by you.
              At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can
              target one
              additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each
              other when
              you target them.

              Classes: Cleric, Paladin, Warlock
              <br>
              You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom
              saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if
              it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it. Some typical commands
              and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM
              determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends. Approach. The
              target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet
              of you. Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn. Flee. The target spends its
              turn moving away from you by the fastest available means. Grovel. The target falls prone and then ends its
              turn. Halt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it
              is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the
              air.
              At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one
              additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when
              you target them.

              You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6
              necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack. Also, choose one ability when you cast
              the spell. The target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

              If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent
              turn of yours to curse a new creature.

              A Remove Curse cast on the target ends this spell early.

              At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain your
              concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can
              maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.</p>

              A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of
              lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the
              target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to
              deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do
              anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell’s range or if it has total
              cover from you.

              At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage

              You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution

              end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

              One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
              charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron
              appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.

              The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a

              Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell
              ends.

              Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with
              you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use
              your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

              Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine
              whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.

              If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate.
              With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

              A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is
              destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and
              effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

              A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as
              blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.

              The affected area is subject to the following effects.

              frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a
              creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area. You can exclude one or
              more of those types of creatures from this effect.

              Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an
              effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether
              the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity or leader, or creatures of a
              specific sort, such as ores or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for
              the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the
              creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.

              • Courage. Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area.

              • Darkness. Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as well as magical light created by spells of a lower
              level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can’t illuminate the area.

              • Daylight. Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by spells of a lower level than the slot
              you used to cast this spell can’t extinguish the light.

              • Energy Protection. Affected creatures in the area have resistance to one damage type of your choice,
              except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

              • Energy Vulnerability. Affected creatures in the area have vulnerability to one damage type of your
              choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

              • Everlasting Rest. Dead bodies interred in the area can’t be turned into undead.

              • Extradimensional Interference. Affected creatures can’t move or travel using teleportation or by
              extradimensional or interplanar means.

              • Fear. Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.

              • Silence. No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound can reach into it.

              • Tongues. Affected creatures can communicate with any other creature in the area, even if they don’t
              share a common language.

            This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of
            a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in
            any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

            This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an
            object.

            The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature’s power. For the duration, you can
            use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using
            that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already.
            The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.

            You create a burst of thunderous sound, which can be heard 100 feet away. Each creature other than you
            within 5 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 thunder
            damage.

            At Higher Levels. The spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and
            17th level (4d6).

            You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the
            target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target,
            provided that this spell hasn’t ended.
